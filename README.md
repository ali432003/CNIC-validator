# How cnic exposes location and gender ?
It's not just a number. It's like a pakistani DNA or fingerprint. You can get alot information from it. 

It is in pattern `ABCDE-FGHIJKL-M`

- [`A`](#a-province) shows `PROVINCE` e.g `PUNJAB`
- `B` shows `DIVISION` e.g `SARGHODHA`
- `C` shows `DISTRICT`
- `D` shows `TEHSIL`  
- `E` shows `UNION COUNSIL`  

- `FGHIJKL` shows `FAMILY TREE`

- [`M`](#m-gender) shows `GENDER` e.g `MALE` or `FEMALE`

### A (Province)
- If A = 1 Then Resident lives in `KPK`
- If A = 2 Then Resident lives in `FATA`
- If A = 3 Then Resident lives in `PUNJAB`
- If A = 4 Then Resident lives in `SINDH`
- If A = 5 Then Resident lives in `BALOCHISTAN`
- If A = 6 Then Resident lives in `ISLAMABAD`

# Tool
I have created tiny javascript program. So no manuall work needed.
Put cnic and that tool will find and show details (location and gender) itself.
